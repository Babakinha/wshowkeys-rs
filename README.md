# wshowkeys-rs
Wshowkeys is a program to show the keys you are pressing for wayland  
  
This repo is a "fork" of [a fork](https://github.com/ammgws/wshowkeys) of [the actual wshowkeys](https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/wshowkeys)  
I dont really know if you might consider this a fork since its rewritten in another language and doesnt even work yet

# Does it work?
No. It's still kinda a work in progress

# Why?
I saw [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGTN_vHAEIE) talking about wshowkeys and thought it would be cool to make my own

# Why Rust?
"oH EvErYThiNg ShOUlD Be IN RuST BeaCuse MemOry SafE..."  
no. 

I just started learning rust and this looks like a good way to do it
